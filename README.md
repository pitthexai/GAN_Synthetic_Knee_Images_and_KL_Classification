# Generative AI in Orthopedics: An Explainable Deep Few-Shot Image Augmentation Pipeline for Plain Knee Radiographs and Kellgrenâ€“Lawrence Grading

### Introduction

### Datasets
To train and generate synthetic data from the Osteoarthritis Intitative (OAI) two datasets are needed:
1. The 00m package from the OAI repository
2. The 96m package from the OAI repository

You must apply to gain access to these data repositories. You can apply for access here: https://nda.nih.gov/oai. 

### Training FastGAN
The main code for FastGAN is contained in the `fastgan` module. This module is a restructure of the code from the FastGAN paper (available here: https://github.com/odegeasslbc/FastGAN-pytorch). 

To train a model you can run the script `train_fastgan.py`. 

### Evaluating the Model

### Generating Synthetic Data

### Downstream Tasks
The synthetic data generated by these models can be used in several downstream tasks, including, but not limited to, 
1. Normal vs. Abnormal Knee Classification
2. Knee Joint Space Segmentation

Code for these two tasks are included in the `downsteam/` directory.
