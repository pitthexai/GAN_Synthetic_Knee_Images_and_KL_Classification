# Generative AI in Orthopedics: An Explainable Deep Few-Shot Image Augmentation Pipeline for Plain Knee Radiographs and Kellgrenâ€“Lawrence Grading

### Introduction

### Datasets
To train and generate synthetic data from the Osteoarthritis Intitative (OAI) two datasets are needed:
1. The 00m package from the OAI repository
2. The 96m package from the OAI repository

You must apply to gain access to these data repositories. You can apply for access here: https://nda.nih.gov/oai. 

The complete synthetic image database can be accessed here: [Link TBD]
