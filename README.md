# Generative AI in Orthopedics: An Explainable Deep Few-Shot Image Augmentation Pipeline for Plain Knee Radiographs and Kellgren–Lawrence Grading

This GitHub repository includes all Python codes to train, generate, and validate synthetic knee radiographs using a few-shot learning pipeline, along with code to train the downstream task of KL grade classification using only the synthetic images.  

### Osteoarthritis Initiative
The entire dataset (00m/96m) analyzed during the current study is publicly available at the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). You can apply for access here: https://nda.nih.gov/oai. 

### Complete Synthetic Dataset
The complete synthetic image database containing both complete and cropped knee radiographs can be accessed here: [Link TBD]
